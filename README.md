# Wallhaven API Scripts

These are some scripts I made to find wallpapers on wallhaven.cc and and create php that returns random wallpaper.

main.py is the main script that i used to download wallpapers/create list of links

checksize.py is resizer for 4k images since my server can't handle it

wallhavenapi.py is the api wrapper that isn't written by me

index.php is the php that returns random wallpaper
